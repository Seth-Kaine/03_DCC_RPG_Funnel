DCC RPG Quick Start Guide, June 2011



QUICK START GUIDE
Welcome to DCC RPG and Free RPG Day! One of the best things about DCC RPG is that you can roll up a character
in 5 minutes. Well, maybe 10 minutes if you’re new to the game. Yes, it’s really that fast! This simple guide excerpts
the relevant pages from the DCC RPG beta rules to allow you to very quickly roll up 0-level characters on Free
RPG Day. Ready? Let’s get started!


Character creation in the DCC RPG follows these steps:
1. Roll ability scores.
2. Determine 0-level occupation.
3. Calculate saving throws and choose an alignment.
4. Determine randomly determined equipment.--+-
That’s it! Now, grab the character sheet from the end of this packet, then let’s get started.


LEVEL 0
All characters start at 0 level. Most will die in a dungeon, alone and unknown. The few who survive eventually
choose a class in which to advance. When starting a 0-level game, we recommend that each player control 2-3
characters. Trust me, you’ll need them. 

All 0-level characters start with the following:
• 1d4 hit points, modified by Stamina
• 5d12 copper pieces
• -100 XP
• One randomly determined piece of equipment (see table 3-4)
• One randomly determined occupation (see table 1-3)
• Based on the occupation:
 • Possession of and training in one weapon
 • Possession of some trade goods
• A +0 modifier to attack rolls and all saving throws
As the character earns experience points, his XP total advances to 1. When his XP total reaches 1, he may choose a class.

ABILITY SCORES
A character is defined in broad terms by six ability scores. For character creation, roll 3d6 for each ability score listed
on the character sheet, in the order of Strength, Agility, Stamina, Personality, Intelligence, and Luck. You always
roll 3d6, and you always roll and apply the scores in that same order. You do not roll more dice and drop the lowest die, you do not use a point-based buy system, and you do not assign ability scores in any order other than that defined
above.
Once you’ve rolled your abilities, note your modifier on the character sheet. Then roll d30 on Table 1-2 to determine what
kind of roll your Luck score modifies.

OCCUPATION
Your character once toiled away at mundane tasks, and his
family and peers still do. Whether alongside his family or
apprenticed to a master, his former occupation provides
some set of skills – useful perhaps only as a fallback when he emerges crippled from the dungeon, but useful nonetheless. These skills
also include training in a rudimentary weapon of some kind. Roll
d% on table 1-3 to determine a character’s background. Unless noted
otherwise, a character is human.
Note that a character’s occupation need not be determined randomly. If a player has a strong sense of the character’s background in
mind already, he should feel free to use it. Starting trained weapon
and trade goods can be determined thematically with the judge’s
approval.
TRADE GOODS
Novice adventurers typically hail from mundane backgrounds. The economics of a feudal setting involve more
barter than coinage. The typical farmer or woodcutter may
sustain his family for years of trade without ever setting eye on a
metal coin. All 0-level characters start with trade goods of some kind,
as indicated on table 1-3. These may be useful in the dungeon or may
provide a starting point for trading up to a better status in life.
You will discover that 0-level characters possess almost no equipment. Begin play with a properly sized party (at least 15 PCs), and
you will quickly learn what “wealth by attrition” means and how it
applies to low-level play.
ALIGNMENT
In the beginning there was the Void, where the Old Ones
dreamed. In their dreams were Law and Chaos, inherent
forces of unity and entropy. Through endless opposition,
these forces of unity and entropy elected champions who became
gods, who in turn formed planes of existence that reflected their
principles. On one such plane resides your trivial existence, tiny next
to the vastness of Aéreth, even tinier next to the vastness of the cosmos. But you are connected back to the greater universe and the endless struggle by a fundamental choice: do you back the forces of Law
or the forces of Chaos?
Alignment is a choice of values. In its simplest form it determines
behavior. In higher forms, it determines allegiance to a cosmic force.
Characters choose an alignment at 0 level, and it determines their
options for the rest of their life.
Alignment functions on many levels, but there are two primary extremes: lawful and chaotic, with the balance of neutrality between. A
character chooses one of these three alignments at 0 level.
And that’s it. Now start your adventure!
